# CraigsList: New Views

## Description

This is a Chrome Extension for improving your CraigsList experience.

It saves your spot on any given CraigsList page, so that you only have to look through new posts.

A red line appears above the last post you've seen, so you know when to stop.


## Details

The extension is built with vanilla js, having no external dependencies.

The website is built with Bootstrap, Sass, and a bunch of other little things.
